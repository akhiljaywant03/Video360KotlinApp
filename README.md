# Video360KotlinApp
This repo is a sample app for showing 360 videos in 2D using an adaptation of https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk

## Software and Hardware Requirements
The minSDK is set to 24. The 2D version of the 360 experiences work on devices that meet this minimum. 

If your screen allows 1080p or better, it should be sufficient to view a 360 4K Video.

## VR 360 Sample Videos
We currently need a sample video under raw/ directory in order to test the application. 
The example I've used is https://vimeo.com/215984021. You may download this video, name it vrsample.mp4, and make sure it is placed under res/raw/ in order to test the current 360 Video feature.
